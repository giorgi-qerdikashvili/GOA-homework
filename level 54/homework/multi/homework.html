            <p>Java, C#, and Python are programming languages used to create software and make computers perform tasks. Java is commonly used to build large, reliable systems such as business software, web servers, and Android applications. C# is often used to develop Windows applications, web services, and games, especially within the Microsoft ecosystem, because it integrates closely with Microsoft tools and platforms.Python is widely used for automation, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and general scripting because it is easy to read, quick to write, and well suited for solving problems efficiently.</p>
