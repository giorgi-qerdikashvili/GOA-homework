        <h1><i>Cadillac Celestiq</i></h1>
        <img src="cadi.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The Cadillac Celestiq (/səˈlɛstɪk/ se-LESS-tick) is a battery electric car made by the Cadillac division of General Motors.[1] It is the brand's flagship sedan, replacing the Cadillac CT6.[1] Production commenced in 2024
            Cadillac builds the Celestiq by hand,[1] having invested US$81 million to create a low-volume production line at its Technical Center (GMTC) in Warren, Michigan.[3]

Since it was completed in 1956, only concept and show cars have been assembled at GMTC. The Celestiq is the first vehicle sold to the public that was assembled at GMTC.[4]

One of the vehicle's distinct features is its smart glass roof, manufactured by Research Frontiers.[5] Other reported features include a dashboard-width touchscreen, all-wheel drive and four-wheel steering.[6] It is expected to use more than a hundred 3D printed components.[7] It is anticipated the Celestiq will be fitted with GM's next generation "Ultra Cruise" advanced driver-assistance system, running on Qualcomm's Snapdragon Ride platform.[8][9]

Like the Cadillac Lyriq, an electric SUV which precedes it, the Celestiq uses GM's Ultium battery technology and BEV3 platform</p>
