        <h1>Ferrari 296</h1>
        <img src="ferrari.html" alt="">
        <p>The Ferrari 296 (Type F171)[4] is a sports car built since 2022 by the Italian company Ferrari. The 296 is a two-seater, offered as a GTB coupe and a GTS folding hard-top convertible. It is a plug-in hybrid with a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout and its powertrain combines a twin-turbocharged 120-degree bank angle V6, with an electric drive fitted in between the engine and gearbox.[clarification needed] The 296 can be driven in electric-only mode for short distances, to comply with use in urban zero-emission zones.

        Unveiled on 24 June 2021,[5] the 296 is Ferrari's first stock model with 6-cylinders other than the Dino 206 GT, 246 GT and 246 GTS cars produced by Ferrari but sold under the Dino marque. Its power pack puts out a combined 830 PS (610 kW; 819 hp), giving the 296 a power-to-weight ratio of 560 hp/ton. </p>
