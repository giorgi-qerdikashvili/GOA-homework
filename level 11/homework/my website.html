        <img src="1.jpg" alt="">
        <strong>The Mexican red-knee is often the first pet for spider enthusiasts. The females can live around 20 to 30 years while the males only live for about 10 years. A 5- to 10-gallon tank is suitable for these tarantulas. And as they're quite docile, they typically are easy to handle. </strong>
