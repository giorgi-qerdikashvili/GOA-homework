    <h1>About egypt</h1>
    <p>Egypt (Arabic: مصر, romanized: Miṣr, pronounced [mɪsˤr] ⓘ, Egyptian Arabic: [mɑsˤr]), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia via the Sinai Peninsula. It is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Palestine (Gaza Strip) and Israel to the northeast, the Red Sea to the east, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west; the Gulf of Aqaba in the northeast separates Egypt from Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Cairo is the capital, largest city, and leading cultural center, while Alexandria is the second-largest city and an important hub of industry and tourism.[21] With over 107 million inhabitants, Egypt is the third-most populous country in Africa and 15th-most populated in the world. </p>
